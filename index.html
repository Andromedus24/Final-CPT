			<h2>What our program accomplishes</h2>
			<p>We created an AP Chem Learning Site directly correlated with Collegeboard's Standards in order to
			help student learn and practice for both the AP Chem exam and AP Chem Unit Tests for all 9 units. Our
			goal is to help students achieve a 5 on the exam and pass all of the unit exams within a reasonable time
			frame. We look forward to empowering you on your AP Chem Journey!</p>

			<h2>How our program operates</h2>
			<h3>The Units</h3>
			<p>Our program has several key components, the first of which is the different Unit Pages.
			If you would like to find out more about each of the units, then you can click the Units 
			button on the top left of the header bar. If you would like to access a specific units 
			resources, then you can hover over the Units Button and different Unit options will appear.
			By clicking on any specific unit, you can learn more about them through notes, formulas, and 
			key concepts that we have compounded as resources. </p>
			<h3>Quizzes & Tests</h3>
			<p>In order to best provide users with the most realistic experience of a quiz or test, we have created various
			quizzes and tests that the user can access and solve, which will return a score aswell as their correct and wrong
			answers. Our focus for this part of our application is to be easy to use and practical, with a focus on providing 
			tests that mirror Collegeboard's curriculum and simplify the process to make it easier for the user to use.
			</p>
			<h3>Subject Reccomendations</h3>
			<p>This page is designed to provide the user with a set of Reccomendations that they can use to then refine those
			respective areas we reccomend. This works by having the user provide a set of topics and key concepts that they are 
			having trouble with and our application providing them a specific unit and area of curriculum to study. The set of key 
			concepts and topics will be taken as per Collegeboard's curriculum, and our reccomending algorithim will be designed to 
			provide the most accurate and helpful reccomendations that we hope will help the user improve there AP Chem skills.
			</p>
			<h3>The Home Page</h3>
			<p>The Home Page has various information about our application, ranging from what our program accomplishes, to how our program
			operates, to the various inputs and outputs we have, to our overarching goal. This part of our application will have general
			information that we hope will enable the user to have a better user experience, navigate our website better, and understand its 
			benefits.
